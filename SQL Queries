--Table Creation: I went with one table, since we can just SELECT UNIQUE for the Categories to get that information
--which feels like an elegant solution for us.  Do you guys have any issues with that approach?

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `Questions` (
	`id` int(10) NOT NULL auto_increment,
	`category` varchar(255),
	`questiontext` varchar(255),
	`answertext` varchar(255),
	PRIMARY KEY( `id` )
);

--Query to identify Categories within table

SELECT DISTINCT category
FROM Questions;

--Query to identify # of categories in table (important, since there must be at least 12 categories for the game)

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT category) AS category_count
FROM Questions;

--I have an "add question" function. This will in effect be our "add category" function as well, since
--if there's a new category, it'd be input this way
--Variables will be delivered as arguments via the Java interface.
--varA: Serialized ID number
--varB: Category for Question
--varC: Question Text
--varD: Answer Text

INSERT INTO Questions (id, category, questiontext, answertext)
VALUES (varA, varB, varC, varD)

--This will be the "Delete Category" function, it just takes out everything with the same 
--varA: the category we wish to delete

DELETE FROM Questions
WHERE category = varA
