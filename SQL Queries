--Table Creation: I went with one table, since we can just SELECT UNIQUE for the Categories to get that information
--which feels like an elegant solution for us.  Do you guys have any issues with that approach?

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `Questions` (
	`id` int(10) NOT NULL auto_increment,
	`category` varchar(255),
	`questiontext` varchar(255),
	`answertext` varchar(255),
	PRIMARY KEY( `id` )
);
